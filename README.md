# X-ray Trace

Program I wrote in grad school to help with Bragg optic setup for x-ray emission spectra collection from dense plasmas and x-ray Thomson scattering experiments. 

Several classes of Bragg optic are defined: flat, conical, spherical, cylindrical.

Bragg's Law is the only real physics incorporated into the engine. I had planned to incorporate more (e.g. depth broadening, absorption, etc), but I decided to defend instead.
