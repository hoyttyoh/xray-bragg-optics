# X-ray Trace

Program I wrote in grad school while working in the [Lab of Plasma Studies](https://www.lps.cornell.edu) to help myself and other researchers with Bragg optic setup for x-ray emission spectra collection from dense plasmas and x-ray Thomson scattering experiments. 

Several different geometries of Bragg optic are defined: 
* flat
* conical 
* spherical
* cylindrical

Bragg's Law is the only real physics incorporated into the engine. I had planned to incorporate more (e.g. depth broadening, absorption, etc), but I decided to defend instead.
